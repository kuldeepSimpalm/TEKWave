Ext.field.TimePicker
====================

A time picker form field for Sencha Touch 2.0

About
-------------------------

TimePicker adds easy-to-use and easy-to-configure  time-picking abilities to your Sencha Touch 2.0 forms. Like the Ext.field.DatePicker, TimePicker displays a OS-like picker that allows the user to select a specific time. 

Although TimePicker allows you to selectively create "time" values via segments, it inevitably treats the value like a single date, so keep this in mind when use it to bind to your models.

Currently, TimePicker allows you to configure 5 slots:
* Hour
* Minute
* Second
* Millisecond
* Meridiem (e.g., AM/PM)

Installation
------------
Installing this is super simple. Simply copy both js files into your SDK's src/ux folder.

NOTE: Both files are required as TimePicker relies on Ext.ux.picker.Time for it's implementation of the picker.

Configuration
-------------

Configuring TimePicker, like DatePicker, is a combination of setting up config for both classes. All configuration for the picker needs to be set via the "picker" config within Ext.field.TimePicker:

> Ext.create('Ext.field.TimePicker', {
>     picker: {
>       // Ext.ux.picker.Time config here...
>     }
>});
